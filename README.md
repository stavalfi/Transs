TRANSS V0.1

Want to update your stories’ state in the JIRA/Trello?
Just click the button, take a photo of your physical scrum board and GO!

TRANSS will process the photo, and by using the story ID, it updates the story state in JIRA/Trello.
Currently we have the following states:
•	To do
•	In Progress
•	Done

Good luck!
And don’t forget – we achieve trust through transparency.
